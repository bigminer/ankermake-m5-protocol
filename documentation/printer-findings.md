# Printer Findings Ledger

**Read this before any printer work.** It is the canonical record of what we know
about this M5C, how we learned it, and — critically — **how much to trust each
claim**. Append to it as findings land. Never delete a refuted entry; mark it
`REFUTED` and say why. A wrong belief we can see is safer than one we re-derive.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CONFIRMED` | Directly observed, reproduced, or read from firmware source. |
| `STRONG` | Multiple consistent lines of evidence, no direct proof. |
| `UNVERIFIED` | Plausible, untested. Do not act as if true. |
| `INVALID-TEST` | We ran a test; the test could not have measured what we thought. |
| `REFUTED` | We believed it; evidence killed it. Kept so we don't re-derive it. |
| `SESSION-ONLY` | True until the next power cycle. Worthless after. |

## Verified command reference

**Every row was run against this printer and the evidence is the actual reply.**
Timestamps are local (UTC-5). If a command isn't here, we have not verified it —
do not assume it behaves as stock Marlin does. `M401` is the cautionary tale: it
looked inert and moved the toolhead 14.9mm.

### Reads — safe, no motion, no heat

| Command | Does | Evidence (verbatim reply) | Verified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `M114` | Reports position **and raw stepper counts** | `X:-15.00 Y:232.50 Z:11.55 E:0.00 Count X:-1920 Y:29760 Z:4620` | 2026-07-15 00:38 |
| `M119` | Endstop pin states | `x_min: open` `y_max: open` `z_min: open` `z2_min: open` `z_probe: open` | 2026-07-15 01:03 |
| `M851` | Probe offset | `Probe Offset X0 Y0 Z0.02` | 2026-07-15 01:03 |
| `APP_QUERY_STATUS` — commandType **1027** (`0x403`), no payload | Bursts ~16 telemetry types the UI never asks for | `1039 {"breakPoint":1}`, `1072 {"isLeveled":1}`, `1052 {...}`, `1067 {button map}`, `1098 {"filamentType":["PLA"]}` | 2026-07-14 21:55 |

⚠️ **`M119` cannot see StallGuard.** `SENSORLESS_HOMING` is enabled; if Z detection
is stall-based it only registers **during motion**. `z_probe: open` on a stationary
nozzle — even one pressed hard into the plate — proves nothing. See `INVALID-TEST`
in Retracted claims.

### Writes — these move the printer. Operator confirmation required.

| Command | Does | Evidence | Verified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `M401` | ⚠️ **Lifts Z ~14.9mm** and sets `Z:2.00`. Does **not** arm the probe. | count `-5160`→`800` (+5960 = 14.9mm), camera confirmed ~15mm lift; `M119` still `z_probe: open` after. `Z:2.00` exactly matches `ANTHER_Z_RISE_DISTANCE 2` | 2026-07-15 01:01:57 |
| `G91` / `G1 Z<n>` / `G90` | Relative **Z** jog. **Send as three separate messages** — Marlin treats `;` as a comment, so `G91;G1...;G90` silently runs only `G91`. Do not generalize this result to X/Y: later unhomed X/Y requests replied `echo:Home X/Y` and did not move. | Z jog traces track exactly 400 counts/mm | 2026-07-15 00:38–01:01 |
| `G28 X Y` | Expected to home X/Y against **real** endstops (`x_min`, `y_max`). The only homing form `/ws/ctrl` permits | guard logic in `web/__init__.py`; endstops present in `M119` | behavior **NOT run live** — `UNVERIFIED`, not established safe |

### Known-dangerous — do not send

| Command | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `G28` (bare), `G28 Z`, any `G28` with Z | Drives nozzle into plate. Blocked at `/ws/ctrl`. |
| `MOVE_ZERO` (1026 / `0x0402`) | Same. Blocked at `/ws/ctrl`. |
| `G36` | ACKs, no motion, **wedges the command queue**, needs a power cycle. |
| `RECOVER_FACTORY` (1029 / `0x0405`) | Factory reset. Destroys printer config. |
| `M402` | Untested. Presumed inverse of `M401` — may **lower** Z ~15mm. |

### Unverified but likely useful

| Command | Expected | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `G92 Z0` | Expected to declare current position as zero without motion; proposed mechanism for manual logical zeroing. | `UNVERIFIED` — not yet sent/observed on this printer |
| `M290 Z<n>` | Babystep. **Invisible to `M114`** (shifts carriage without changing logical position) — will desync any position monitor. The UI's z-offset buttons use this; the jog buttons don't. | `STRONG`, inferred from `static/ankersrv.js` + count behaviour |
| `M500` / `M501` | Save/load EEPROM. Untouched. | `UNVERIFIED` |

## Tooling: `scripts/printer-probe.py`

Consolidates the throwaway scripts every session kept rewriting.

```sh
scripts/printer-probe.py pos          # M114 - position + stepper counts
scripts/printer-probe.py endstops     # M119 + M851 (prints the StallGuard caveat)
scripts/printer-probe.py status       # APP_QUERY_STATUS burst, annotated
scripts/printer-probe.py watch 120    # poll M114, print changes only
scripts/printer-probe.py gcode "M105" # arbitrary send; refuses the dangerous set
```

| Aspect | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Dangerous-command guard (`G28`/`G28 Z`/`G28 X Z`/`N20 G28 Z`/`g28 z`/`G36`/`M402` refused; `G28 X Y`/`G28 X`/`M114`/`M119`/`M851`/`G92 Z0` allowed) | `CONFIRMED` 2026-07-15 01:20 |
| Live read paths (`pos`/`endstops`/`status`/`watch`) | `UNVERIFIED` — printer went silent before they could be exercised. Built from scripts that worked at 00:38–01:03, but not proven in this form. **Test before trusting.** |

## Transport quick reference

**Auth** (token is *not* in `.env` — it's in the LaunchAgent):
```sh
plutil -extract EnvironmentVariables.ANKERCTL_TOKEN raw -o - \
  ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ankerctl.webserver.plist
# then POST it to /login as `token=<value>` to get a session cookie.
# Pass via a body file, not argv — keeps it out of `ps` and out of logs.
```

**Send G-code** — `ws://127.0.0.1:4470/ws/ctrl`:
```json
{"mqtt": {"commandType": 1043, "cmdData": "M114", "cmdLen": 4},
 "awaitResponse": true, "requestId": "anything"}
```
`1043` = `0x0413` = `ZZ_MQTT_CMD_GCODE_COMMAND`. Shape mirrors `sendGcode()` in
`static/ankersrv.js`.

**Send a query** — same endpoint, no cmdData: `{"mqtt": {"commandType": 1027}}`

**Feeds:** `/ws/mqtt` = raw · `/ws/state` = normalized (nozzle/bed/print/speed/state)

### Gotchas that cost real time on 2026-07-14/15

| Gotcha | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| `/ws/ctrl` replies `{"ankerctl": 1}` | **That is not the printer's reply.** It's an ack from ankerctl. The real reply arrives on `/ws/mqtt` as commandType `1043` with `resData`. Listen there. |
| `1043` traffic floods with temp polls | Before the 2026-07-19 uncommitted mitigation, the browser polled `M105` every 10s even while telemetry flowed. Filter replies starting `ok T:` when reading older captures. Fresh `/ws/state` traffic now suppresses the next poll in browser tests; live revalidation is still needed. |
| Background monitors print nothing | Python buffers stdout to a file. Use `python -u`. |
| Playwright screenshots vanish | They land in the **repo root**, not the output dir. Move them out; keep the worktree clean. |
| `ankerctl mqtt monitor` fails to connect | It dials cloud (`make-mqtt.ankermake.com`). The printer is on the **local broker**. Use the running service's websockets instead. |
| Printer silent right after a power cycle | Needs 30–60s to rejoin the `M5C-Local` hotspot. Silence ≠ a result. `ping` the hotspot lease first. |
| Replies carry a `+ringbuf:N,512,M` suffix | Anker-specific. Ignore it when parsing. |
| **Sends fail *silently* when ankerctl is wedged** | No error, no timeout, no clue. Confirm telemetry is flowing *before* sending. `2026-07-15 01:25` |
| "The printer is silent" means **ankerctl**, not the printer | `REFUTED` as a general rule on 2026-07-19. It described the 2026-07-15 wedge, but a later print lost the printer's broker client and hotspot neighbor while `ankerctl` and the local stack stayed healthy. Check the broker log first and branch on whether printer PUBLISHes continue. |

### ⚠️ FIRST: locate the silent layer before restarting anything

Check `/opt/ankerm5c/logs/mosquitto.out.log` first:

- Printer PUBLISHes are still growing but web state is stale: the printer and
  broker are alive; an `ankerctl` restart is a supported recovery attempt.
- The printer client disconnected and PUBLISHes stopped: restarting `ankerctl`
  cannot force the remote printer back onto the hotspot. Check ARP/ping,
  hotspot association, and radio placement. Any printer power cycle still
  requires a present operator and explicit authorization.

The restart-first account below is retained as a dated incident, not a general
runbook.

```sh
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.ankerctl.webserver
```

`CONFIRMED` 2026-07-15 01:47. **ankerctl's MQTT and PPPP service threads wedge.**
They keep reporting `Running` while receiving nothing. Symptoms look exactly like a
dead printer: no telemetry, jog buttons do nothing, uploads stall at `Sending file
contents`, `M114` gets no reply. `/ws/pppp-state` throws `ServiceStoppedError`.

**In that 2026-07-15 incident, the printer was fine.** The distinguishing check
was what the broker was actually receiving:
```sh
tail -f /opt/ankerm5c/logs/mosquitto.out.log   # printer's own PUBLISHes
```
If that is growing, the printer-to-broker path is healthy and `ankerctl` is the
likely problem. If it is not growing, do not infer the same diagnosis; the
2026-07-19 hotspot/MQTT disconnect requires separate network recovery.

This cost an hour on 2026-07-15 chasing pf anchors, dnsmasq, and mosquitto — **all
healthy**. The printer had rejoined the broker minutes after a power cycle and was
publishing every ~3s throughout. Do not repeat that.

### DEFECT (FIXED 2026-07-15): the UI reported success for commands that never landed

`CONFIRMED` 2026-07-15 01:30. With ankerctl wedged, the operator clicked jog Z+1mm
several times: buttons **enabled**, **no error**, nothing moved, nothing logged.

**Fix applied** (`static/ankersrv.js`): the heartbeat machinery already tracked
liveness (`lastPrinterHeartbeat` / `lastTelemetry`, 15s stale window) and
`updatePrinterState()` already resolved to `"Offline"` — the controls just never
consulted it. Now:

- `printerIsLive()` extracted as the single source of truth
- `updateAttendedControls()` gates on `ctrlReady() && printerIsLive()`
- controls re-evaluate on the heartbeat interval **and** on each heartbeat reply
  (liveness changes there, and nothing else re-ran them)
- `sendMqtt()` refuses non-heartbeat sends when offline — **the heartbeat is
  exempt**, since it is the probe that restores liveness; blocking it would make
  recovery impossible

Covered by `test_controls_disable_when_the_printer_stops_answering` and
`test_offline_printer_refuses_to_send_but_still_heartbeats`. Note
`test_control_buttons_enable_when_ctrl_socket_opens` was **renamed** to
`test_control_buttons_require_a_live_printer` — it asserted the old, buggy
contract (enabled purely because a socket opened).

Original analysis follows.

Cause (`static/ankersrv.js:426`):
```js
const controlReady = sockets.ctrl && sockets.ctrl.is_open;
```
That's the **browser's socket to ankerctl** — it says nothing about whether the
command reached the printer. `/api/ankerctl/status` has the same flaw: its
`Running` states describe ankerctl's threads. **Nothing in the stack tracks whether
the printer received anything.**

Note `filetransfer` is the one layer that *does* fail loudly — it waits for block
acks and aborts after 15s. That's the model for a fix: gate controls on evidence
the printer answered (e.g. last-telemetry age), not on socket state.

This is recommended-work item 5 from `handoff.md`, now evidenced. Independent of
the wedge bug: any dropped link produces the same silent failure.

### Stranded commands

Commands sent while ankerctl is wedged vanish. `G91`/`G1 Z1`/`G90` sent 2026-07-15
01:25 **never executed** — camera confirmed the toolhead unmoved after reconnect.
Whether the broker can queue commands across a session is `UNVERIFIED`; no evidence
of it so far. Still: confirm telemetry is flowing before sending anything.

---

## Homing — the central open problem

**Nothing we can send makes this printer home Z. Four attempts, all failed.**

| Attempt | Result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raw `G28` | Nozzle driven into plate, no probe engagement | `CONFIRMED` |
| `MOVE_ZERO` (`0x0402`/1026, value 2) | Same unsafe descent | `CONFIRMED` |
| `G36` after preheat | ACKed, no motion, timed out, queue wedged | `CONFIRMED` |
| `M401` (deploy probe) | Lifted Z ~14.9mm; **did not** arm probe | `CONFIRMED` |

**Failure cost (operator, 2026-07-14):** neither plate strike damaged the printer.
Extra pressure on plate and gantry, nothing more. Do not describe these as crashes
or imply damage — inflated framing distorted risk judgement for a whole session.

### Firmware facts (read from source, V8110_DVT `Configuration.h` / `_adv.h`)

Source: `github.com/eufymake/eufyMake-Marlin-M5C`, path
`release_marlin2.0/Marlin/Configuration/V8110/V8110_DVT/`. **V8110 is the M5C.**

| Finding | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The nozzle **is** the probe; no sensors in the plate | `#define NOZZLE_AS_PROBE` | `CONFIRMED` |
| Z homing requires **trusted XY** | `#define Z_SAFE_HOMING` — *"Allows Z homing only when XY positions are known and trusted"* | `CONFIRMED` |
| Z homes to center | `Z_SAFE_HOMING_X_POINT/Y_POINT = X_CENTER/Y_CENTER` | `CONFIRMED` |
| Marlin's probe-arming machinery is **off** | `//#define PROBE_TARE`, `//#define PROBE_ACTIVATION_SWITCH` — both commented | `CONFIRMED` |
| `PROBE_TARE` is exactly this hardware's mechanism | Its comment: *"Useful for a strain gauge or piezo sensor…"* | `CONFIRMED` |
| StallGuard homing is enabled | `#define SENSORLESS_HOMING`, `Z_STALL_SENSITIVITY 95` | `CONFIRMED` |
| Sensorless *probing* is off | `//#define SENSORLESS_PROBING` | `CONFIRMED` |
| Z homing uses the probe, on a dedicated pin | `#define USE_PROBE_FOR_Z_HOMING`; `//#define Z_MIN_PROBE_USES_Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_PIN` | `CONFIRMED` |
| `ANKER_PROBE_TIMEOUT 12000` / `ANTHER_Z_DROP_DISTANCE -14` / `ANTHER_Z_RISE_DISTANCE 2` exist | `Configuration_adv.h:2993+` | `CONFIRMED` |
| …but that block sits inside `#if ENABLED(USE_Z_SENSORLESS)` and **`USE_Z_SENSORLESS` is not defined in either config file** — may be dead code | grep of both headers | `UNVERIFIED` |

### The XY-is-fiction hypothesis (operator's insight, 2026-07-15)

`M114` reports `X:-15.00 Y:232.50` — **off the 220x220 bed**. Yet the operator
physically touched the plate with that nozzle. The firmware's XY belief and
physical reality disagree. XY was never homed this boot; the values are restored
park coordinates, and on a bed-slinger both axes move freely by hand when off.

Combined with `Z_SAFE_HOMING`'s "known and trusted" requirement, this is the best
current explanation for why probing never engages: **we have been asking the
printer to probe from a coordinate frame it does not trust.** A real print homes
XY first, which is why real prints probe fine.

Status: `STRONG`. **Untested.** The proposed test starts with `G28 X Y` (real
`x_min`/`y_max` endstops; also the one form `/ws/ctrl` permits) followed by
`M114` to see if the position was lying. It has not been run live and must not
be called safe merely because the endstops exist. Any later move-to-center/probe
experiment needs a separate safety review and fresh operator confirmation; the
two known standalone Z-homing attempts remain blocked.

### Retracted claims — do not re-derive these

| Claim | Why it died |
| --- | --- |
| "`z_probe: open` under load is the root cause" | `SENSORLESS_HOMING` is enabled. If Z detection is StallGuard, it only senses **during motion** — a stationary pressed nozzle produces no stall by design. The `M119`-while-holding test could not have measured what we thought. `INVALID-TEST`, not evidence of a fault. |
| "The probe is gated by Anker's comm module" | Plausible but never evidenced; `Z_SAFE_HOMING` + untrusted XY explains the same observations without inventing a gatekeeper. `UNVERIFIED` at best. |
| "This printer has no proprioception" | `M114` works fine and reports position + raw step counts. The *codebase* never asks; the firmware always knew. `REFUTED`. |
| "`M401` won't move anything (no servo)" | It lifted the toolhead 14.9mm off a plate it was pressed against. "No servo" ≠ "no motion". `REFUTED`. |
| "Leveling EEPROM was corrupted by the plate strikes" | `1072 isLeveled: 1`. Data intact. `REFUTED`. |

---

## Position and coordinate frame

| Finding | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `M114` works: reports X/Y/Z + raw stepper counts | `X:-15.00 Y:232.50 Z:11.55 Count X:-1920 Y:29760 Z:4620` | `CONFIRMED` |
| Z is **400 steps/mm** | Every observed 1mm Z jog = 400 counts; every 10mm Z jog = 4000, across a 51mm Z span | `CONFIRMED` |
| **X/Y counts survive a power cycle exactly; Z resets to 0** | Before/after reboot: X `-1920`→`-1920`, Y `29760`→`29760`, Z `4620`→`0` | `CONFIRMED` |
| Therefore **recording a Z number across a reboot is worthless** | Counter zeroes regardless of physical position | `CONFIRMED` |
| Reported Z is **not stable across commands** — track the **count** | `M401` cleared a `+0.25` offset; the same physical point went `-12.55` → `-12.80` | `CONFIRMED` |
| A `+0.25mm` offset exists below zero, origin unknown | count 0 → `Z:0.25`; cleared by `M401` | `UNVERIFIED` |
| `M851` reports `Probe Offset X0 Y0 Z0.02` | direct read | `CONFIRMED` |
| A stored Z offset can't be made durable without a Z home | An offset needs a repeatable datum; homing *is* the datum | `STRONG` |
| Supervised 1mm X+/X-/Y+/Y- relative request pair left the reported frame unchanged | each `G91` → bounded `G1` → `G90` sequence was accepted; afterward `M114` reported X:-15.00, Y:232.50, Count X:-1920/Y:29760 | request/reply `CONFIRMED`; later operator review confirmed no physical motion |
| Supervised 10mm X+/X-/Y+/Y- relative request pair left the reported frame unchanged | each `G91` → `G1 … F3000` → `G90` sequence was accepted; afterward `M114` again reported X:-15.00, Y:232.50, Count X:-1920/Y:29760 | request/reply `CONFIRMED`; later operator review confirmed no physical motion |
| Supervised 50mm X+/X-/Y+/Y- relative request sequence repeated three times left the reported frame unchanged | operator confirmed clearance; all 12 bounded `G91` → `G1 … F3000` → `G90` legs were accepted; afterward `M114` reported X:-15.00, Y:232.50, Count X:-1920/Y:29760 | request/reply `CONFIRMED`; operator observed no physical motion |
| Raw relative X/Y jog requests did not produce observable motion | operator watched the earlier 1mm/10mm tests and the 3×50mm sequence; none moved despite broker delivery and printer replies. Each `G1 X…`/`G1 Y…` reply included `echo:Home X`/`echo:Home Y`. | `CONFIRMED` for the observed no-motion result; root cause `UNVERIFIED` |

### Manual plate finding works; logical zeroing needs revalidation (2026-07-15)

The operator established a physical Z reference the probe could not: jog down,
paper-drag test, 0.1mm steps. **Plate found at count -5120.**
`G28`/`MOVE_ZERO`/`G36`/`M401` all failed to do this; hands and a sheet of paper
took four minutes.

`SESSION-ONLY` — and unavoidably so. It works *because* the operator is the datum,
and a person's judgement can't be serialized to EEPROM. Per power cycle, redo it.
`G92 Z0` is the proposed declaration mechanism, but it was not validated in this
session and remains `UNVERIFIED`. Never record-and-replay the count: a replayed Z
from a dead frame is a plunge.

## Printer state and telemetry

| Finding | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_QUERY_STATUS` (`0x403`/1027) is the **broadest diagnostic query we have** | Idle captures mainly emitted temperatures; this query returned ~16 types. It still cannot answer after the printer's MQTT client disconnects. | response breadth `CONFIRMED` |
| The persistent red blink observed in this incident represented a **suspended print**, not a fault | `1039 {"breakPoint": 1}` + `1052 {"real_print_layer": 6}` | this incident `CONFIRMED`; do not generalize every red indication |
| A long-press on the physical button clears it | Red→green; `1039` stopped reporting; layer 6→0; 180C hold released | `CONFIRMED` |
| Power-cycling does **not** clear it — it's stored state, not a fault | Operator power-cycled; blink persisted | `CONFIRMED` |
| `1067` returns the physical button map (idle vs busy) | direct read | `CONFIRMED` |
| `1021 Z_AXIS_RECOUP: -5` is a **constant**, not crash damage | Unchanged across every state we've seen | `CONFIRMED` |
| `1072 isLeveled: 1` — leveling survived both plate strikes | direct read | `CONFIRMED` |

### Supervised fan and low-temperature requests (2026-07-19)

After the operator confirmed attendance, a clear bed, and a safe toolhead path,
the live preflight showed that the web service was reachable but the initial
`M105` received no printer reply within 10 seconds. Restarting `ankerctl` made a
subsequent `M105` reply immediately available. The supervised control requests
then completed: part fan 50% then off (`M106 S128`, `M107`), nozzle target 40C
then 0C (`M104 S40`, `M104 S0`), and bed target 35C then 0C (`M140 S35`,
`M140 S0`).

| Finding | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The service can be reachable while a printer reply is absent; restarting `ankerctl` restored an `M105` reply | initial 10s `M105` timeout; retry passed after restart | `CONFIRMED` |
| Fan and low-temperature requests were accepted by the control path | supervised live tests completed without control errors | `CONFIRMED` |
| Both heater targets were cleared after the supervised check | follow-up `M105`: `T:21.00 /0.00 B:21.04 /0.00` (current / target) | `CONFIRMED` |
| The `M107` fan-off request was accepted; resulting fan state is unavailable | the status and `M105` replies expose no fan-state field | physical fan-off outcome `UNVERIFIED` |

Later in the same supervised session, the operator requested that the settings
remain active across an `ankerctl` restart. The control path accepted `M106
S128` (50% part fan), `M104 S40`, and `M140 S35`; after the restart, the broad
status query reported idle state and `M105` reported `T:39.00 /40.00 B:26.16
/35.00`. The restart therefore did not clear the heater targets.

| Finding | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low heater targets persist across an `ankerctl` restart | post-restart `M105`: nozzle 39.00/40.00C, bed 26.16/35.00C | `CONFIRMED` |
| Whether the 50% part-fan request persists across an `ankerctl` restart | command was accepted, but no fan-state telemetry exists | `UNVERIFIED` |
| Supervised shutdown cleared both heater targets | `M107`, `M104 S0`, and `M140 S0` accepted; immediate `M105`: nozzle 40.00/0.00C, bed 34.87/0.00C | `CONFIRMED` |

### Orca-started job observation (2026-07-19)

The operator started a job through Orca while this session issued no printer
action. A read-only status query found an active queued job with zero progress
and zero completed layers. `M105` reported nozzle 149/150C and bed 42.94/60C,
consistent with the printer's preheat/start phase.

| Finding | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| An Orca-started job reaches the printer through the local control setup | read-only status reported a queued job and its layer metadata | `CONFIRMED` |
| The printer owns its preheat targets during job start | `M105`: nozzle 149/150C, bed 42.94/60C | `CONFIRMED` |
| The job transitions from queued/start to printing during its own calibration sequence | subsequent read-only status reported printer state value 1, still at zero progress/layers | `CONFIRMED` |
| A direct `M105` request may time out while the start sequence is active | status query still returned printing state; the following `M105` received no reply within 10s | `CONFIRMED` for the timeout; cause `UNVERIFIED` |
| MQTT observation can stop while a job continues physically | operator observed the job continue and finish; broker notices stopped, direct local subscription received no packets, and the web state/reply paths timed out | `CONFIRMED` for the observation gap; cause `UNVERIFIED` |
| Restarting `ankerctl` after this job did not immediately restore an `M105` reply | authenticated `M105` still timed out after restart and a settling interval | `CONFIRMED` |
| The gap began when the printer's broker client disconnected; it made no observed reconnect attempt | broker logged the printer client disconnecting with `Host is down`; later control requests still reached the broker but had no printer subscriber and produced no reply | `CONFIRMED` |
| The Mac's local-broker/hotspot stack remained healthy while the printer disappeared from the hotspot | broker, DNS, NTP, Internet Sharing bridge, and pf checks all passed; the printer had 100% loss, no ARP entry, and no response on its known local service ports | observations `CONFIRMED`; weak/offline printer Wi-Fi or an address change `SUPPORTED`, not distinguished |
| Fixed-rate `M105` polling is redundant while normalized state telemetry is arriving | browser regression test shows fresh `/ws/state` traffic suppresses the next heartbeat; one probe resumes after the 15-second stale threshold | `CONFIRMED` in browser test; prevention of a printer Wi-Fi/MQTT disconnect `UNVERIFIED` |

### Same-room hotspot recovery and cold-boot follow-up (2026-07-20)

The operator moved the Mac into the printer's room and had to power the Mac down
and restart it. Placement and hotspot recreation therefore changed together;
the recovery cannot be attributed to distance alone.

| Finding | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The printer rejoined the Mac-hosted hotspot and local broker after the move/reboot | broker client source was on the Internet Sharing subnet; notices resumed every ~3s; passive `/ws/state` reported nozzle 23C with target 0C | recovery `CONFIRMED`; whether placement or reboot caused it `UNVERIFIED` |
| The first 120-packet “same-room” sample tested the wrong address | `setup.local.conf` still held a LAN address routed over `en0`, not the live broker client's hotspot address | `INVALID-TEST` for hotspot quality; do not use its latency figures |
| The actual same-room hotspot link was clean | broker-derived printer address routed over `bridge100`; 30/30 replies, 0% loss, 3.34ms average, 10.96ms maximum; later post-reload sample was 10/10 at 2.60ms average | current link quality `CONFIRMED`; long-print durability still needs revalidation |
| `ankerctl` cached the correct PPPP hotspot address, while the ignored diagnostic config was stale | cached `ip_addr` matched the live broker source; `setup.local.conf` did not and was corrected locally | `CONFIRMED` |
| The Mac cold boot exposed a persistent Chrony PID-file collision | launchd crash-looped; `/opt/ankerm5c/chronyd.pid` named PID 309, which belonged to `storagekitd`; no process listened on UDP/123 | root cause `CONFIRMED` |
| Moving Chrony's PID file to `/var/run` restores the installed NTP service | regression test failed on the persistent path and passed after the change; installed stack reported Chrony listening, runtime PID identified `chronyd`, and all verification checks passed | immediate fix `CONFIRMED`; another cold boot `NEEDS REVALIDATION` |

### Same-room communications and live-print retest (2026-07-20)

After fresh operator clearance, repeated no-motion communications remained
healthy across multiple fan/heater scenarios, 30-60 second pauses, and an
`ankerctl` restart. The operator heard the part fan, but could not distinguish
the requested 25%, 50%, and 100% tiers.

The operator then started a 43-layer Orca job while a passive monitor watched
the actual hotspot path and broker/state streams without periodic manual
`M105` queries. The job was physically aborted at layer 25 after the web Pause
and Stop controls failed; this was not a completed-print test.

| Finding | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Consecutive read/control communications survived long pauses and an `ankerctl` restart | repeated `M105` replies before/after restart and throughout 30-60s dwell scenarios; final targets read 0 | this run `CONFIRMED` |
| Part-fan operation occurred during the tiered scenario | operator heard the fan | operation `CONFIRMED`; 25/50/100% speed accuracy `UNVERIFIED` |
| Same-room passive observation remained continuous through the observed job | 1,099 normalized state messages, 308 notices, zero broker disconnects; 177/177 hotspot pings, 2.9ms average, 20.9ms maximum | through layer 25 `CONFIRMED`; full-job durability `UNVERIFIED` because job was aborted |
| No explicit nozzle-probing telemetry was identified | during physically observed probing, decoded traffic included the normal notice families but no probe point/contact field | absence in this capture `CONFIRMED`; a hidden/undecoded field remains possible |
| Web Pause did not pause this Orca-started job | six outbound publishes received six replies, but progress continued from layer 18 to 19 with no pause/park transition | this Orca job `CONFIRMED`; an uploader-identity mismatch is `SUPPORTED` but not yet live revalidated |
| Minimal web Stop plus `M2024` still failed to cancel this Orca-started job | two more publishes/replies; heaters cooled immediately, but progress/elapsed increased and layers advanced to 25 | this Orca job `CONFIRMED`; control is unsafe pending fix |
| Physical square-button long-press cleared the continuing job | telemetry reset 25/43 to 0; job frames ceased; toolhead moved back-left with Z raised; targets later read 0 | job clear `CONFIRMED`; calling the position "home" `UNVERIFIED` |

This run disproves the claim that restoring the minimal Stop payload is enough
for every upload origin. It had been live-validated in a different job context,
but failed against this Orca-started job. A successful MQTT reply only proves
message handling, not the required physical/job-state transition.

The server-owned action implementation now keeps these contracts separate:
Pause/Resume require the exact trusted upload identity, while Stop is always a
global, identity-free protective action. Stop sends the minimal `1008/value=0`
cancellation and `M2024` immediately, captures the `1008` acknowledgement for
diagnosis, and only reports confirmation after fresh telemetry shows an
inactive/cleared job and zero nozzle and bed targets. This is offline-tested but
still `NEEDS LIVE REVALIDATION`; it does not explain why the 2026-07-20 global
cancellation was acknowledged while the Orca stream continued.

### Named-action live preflight follow-up (2026-07-20)

With fresh operator clearance, validation mode was enabled only for this
attended attempt. No Pause, Resume, or Stop action was ultimately sent because
the synthetic no-motion uploads never produced an active job.

| Finding | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The new snapshot initially failed to expose the printer's actual state | broker traffic was current and forwarded to `ankerctl`; snapshot cursors advanced, but `state` remained unknown because command type 1000/subType 1 stores state in `value`, a shape the normalizer omitted | root cause `CONFIRMED`; regression test and fix added |
| Immediate unknown state after service restart is not itself a communication failure | `/ws/state` first returned cursor 0 with unknown facts; subsequent temperature notices advanced the cursor and a read-only 1027 query supplied state 0 | `CONFIRMED` |
| The file-transfer service did not validate its one-byte acknowledgement result | code waited for an AABB reply but accepted every byte as success; tests now distinguish `OK`, `ERR_BUSY`, and malformed replies | defect `CONFIRMED`; fixed offline |
| Synthetic zero-motion uploads cannot currently serve as a Pause/Resume/Stop fixture | simple dwell, firmware-backed `M109 R0`, and metadata-padded zero-displacement variants all received `OK` transfer acknowledgements and caused a beep, but raw status remained state 0 with no command type 1001 job notice | this fixture approach `INVALID-TEST`; why the communication module immediately completes/ignores it is `UNVERIFIED` |
| The aborted validation left the printer inactive and cold | final raw status: state 0, no active job, nozzle target 0, bed target 0; validation mode was then disabled and the service restarted | session outcome `CONFIRMED` |

Do not infer anything about the new Pause/Resume/Stop implementation from the
synthetic attempts: there was never an active job to act on. The next live test
requires separate authorization for a real slicer-generated job and must retain
the physical-control fallback.

**Lesson worth more than any single reading: when this printer has a hard problem,
the answer has repeatedly been its own physical interface or the runbook — not a
command we inferred.** The button beat every opcode we considered.

## How to add to this file

One row, in the right table, with a status. If you ran a test, ask **"could this
test have measured what I think it measured?"** before recording the result — the
single most valuable line in this document is an `INVALID-TEST`. If you're stating
a conclusion, state the evidence first; if the evidence is thin, the status is
`UNVERIFIED`, however good the story sounds.
